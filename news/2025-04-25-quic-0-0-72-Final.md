We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.72.Final. This is a bug-fix release.

The most important changes are:

* Update to netty 4.1.121.Final ([#792](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/792))
* Correctly detect supported namedGroups during initialization ([#791](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/791))
* CEnsure we don't directly close the stream if we receive a STOP_SENDING frame as there might be data that was not read / processed yet. ([#790](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/790))

For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.0.72.Final).
