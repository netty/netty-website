I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.52.Final. This is mainly a bug-fix release but also contains some new features like MQTT 5.0 support.

The most important changes in this release are:

* Fix ByteBufUtil.getBytes() incorrectly sharing the array in some cases ([#10529](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10529))
* Create a stackless ClosedChannelException to reduce overhead when the Channel is closed ([#10523](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10523))
* Use all configured nameservers when using DnsNameResolver in all cases ([#10503](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10503))
* Expose a LoggingDnsQueryLifeCycleObserverFactory ([#10490](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10490))
* Binary search based IpSubnetFilter ([#10492](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10492))
* Include TLSv1.3 ciphers as recommended ciphers for HTTP2 ([#10480](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10480))
* Correctly limit queries done to resolve unresolved nameservers ([#10478](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10478))
* Add whitelist entry to BlockHound config to workaround issue when TLS1.3 is enabled and the SslProvider.JDK is used ([#10459](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10459))
* Enable TLS1.3 by default of JDK SSLEngine implementation does by default ([#10451](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10451))
* Fix DnsNameResolver may have LEAK ByteBuf after cancelling the returned future ([#10448](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10448))
* Making AES_128_GCM_SHA256 have a higher priority over CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 on HTTP2 ([#10418](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10418))
* Enable SSL_MODE_ENABLE_FALSE_START if jdkCompatibilityMode is false ([#10407](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10407))
* Reduce memory fragmentation caused by PooledByteBufAllocator ([#10267](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10267))
* MQTT5 support for netty-codec-mqtt ([#10483](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10483))
