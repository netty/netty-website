We are happy to announce the release of the first release canidate for the upcoming netty version 4.2.0. Everyone using netty 4.1.x should be able to upgrade to 4.2.0.Alpha4 without any API breakage. The only new requirement is JDK8 or later. 

We encourage users of netty 4.1.x to try out this alpha release and so provide feedback if any breakage is noticed. This will help us to be  aware of any problems early in the release cycle. That said, be aware that this is only an release canidate and so __shouldn't__ be considered for production usage yet.

Netty 4.2.0 will come with some exciting new features that you can learn more about in the announcement of [netty 4.2.0.Alpha1](https://netty.io/news/2024/06/12/4-2-0-Alpha1.html).
