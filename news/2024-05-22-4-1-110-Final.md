We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.110.Final. While this release contains bug-fixes it also comes with two new exciting features. Read on for more details...


The most important changes are:

* Add unix domain socket transport in netty 4.x via JDK16+ ([#13965](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13965))
* Backport #13075: Add the AdaptivePoolingAllocator ([#13976](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13976))
* Add no-value key handling only for form body ([#13998](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13998))
* Add support for specifying SecureRandom in SSLContext initialization ([#14058](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14058))

## New Features

### Unix Domain Sockets
This release adds support for Unix Domain Sockets when using the NIO transport, while before this was only supported when using one of our native transports. That said you will need to use a Java version >= 16 for it.

### AdaptivePoolingAllocator (experimental)
This release contains a backport ([#13976](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13976)) of our `AdaptivePoolingAllocator` that was first introduced in our main branch. This allocator should reduce the memory overhead that you typically might encounter when using the `PooledByteBufAllocator` while also gives the same (or better) performance characterristics. Trying out the new allocator is as easy as either specify `-Dio.netty.allocator.type=adaptive` or set it directly via the `ChannelOption.ALLOCATOR`. 

We would love to receive feedback from everyone that tried the new allocator.
