We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.123.Final. This is a bug-fix release but also contains various performance enhancements in the `AdapativeByteBufAllocator`.

The most important changes are:

* Fix chunk reuse bug in adaptive allocator ([#15428](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15428))
*  More accurate adaptive memory usage accounting ([#15425](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15425))
* Introduce size-classes for the adaptive allocator ([#15414](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15414))
* Reduce magazine proliferation eagerness ([#15422](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15422))
* Fix concurrent ByteBuffer access issue in AdaptiveByteBuf.getBytes ([#15410](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15410))
* Fix possible buffer corruption caused by incorrect setCharSequence(...) implementation ([#15393](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15393))
* AdaptiveByteBuf: Fix AdaptiveByteBuf.maxFastWritableBytes() to take writerIndex() into account ([#15376](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15376))
* Optimize capacity bumping for adaptive ByteBufs ([#15368](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15368))
* AbstractDnsRecord: equals() and hashCode() to ignore name field's case ([#15330](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15330))
* Backport Unsafe guards ([#15346](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15346))
* Guard recomputed offset access with hasUnsafe ([#15357](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15357))
* HTTP2: Always produce a RST frame on stream exception ([#15355](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15355))
* Correct what artifacts included in netty-bom ([#15308](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15308))

## Special note

## AdaptiveByteBufAllocator improvements
The `AdaptiveByteBufAllocator` did see a lot of changes this release to not only fixing bugs but also decrease it's memory overhead dramatically. To ensure we don't regress in the future and also allow others to better understand the characteristics we also added an allocation pattern simulator. For some more details about the improvements please refer to [#15429](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15429)
