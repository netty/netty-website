I'm happy to announce the latest release of the 4.1 series after almost 2 month of hard work.

These release contains bug-fixes, performance enhancements and feature so we encourage everyone to upgrade.

The most important changes are:

* Add OpenSslX509KeyManagerFactory which makes it even easier for people get the maximum performance when using OpenSSL / LibreSSL / BoringSSL  with netty ([#8084](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8084))
* Do not log explicit no unsafe, fixes helper method ([#8111](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8111))
* Fix support for shading native libraries which was broken ([#8091](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8091))
* Remove usage of ObjectCleaner ([#8064](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8064))
* Reorder channel state changes in Http2MultiplexCodec child channel ([#8070](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8070))
* Remove id from DnsQueryContextManager whenever the promise is fulfilled ([#8058](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8058))
* HpackDecoder treats invalid pseudo-headers as stream level errors ([#8046](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8046))
* Allow to cache keymaterial when using OpenSSL ([#8036](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8036))
* Epoll and Kqueue shouldn't read by default ([#8024](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8024))
* Defer channelInactive and channelUnregistered events in Http2MultiplexCodec ([#8021](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8021))
* Provide an API for controlling and h2c upgrade response stream in Http2MultiplexCodec ([#7968](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7968))
* Fix CharSequenceValueConverter.convertToByte implementation for AsciiString ([#7994](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7994))
* Set (and override) websocket handshake headers after custom headers ([#7975](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7975))
* Allow to schedule tasks up to Long.MAX_VALUE ([#7972](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7972))
* Correctly let Http2UnknownFrame extend HttpStreamFrame ([#7976](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7976))
* Read until all data is consumed when EOF is detected  ([#7961](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7961))
* Propagate pong frames in WebSocketProtocolHandler ([#7955](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7955))
* Remove HpackDecoder.maxHeaderListSizeGoAway ([#7911](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7911))
* Guard against calling malloc(0) when create ByteBuffer ([#7948](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7948))
* Correctly clear the error stack in all cases when using ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine ([#7941](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7941))
* Correctly copy existing elements when CodecOutputList.add(index, element) is used ([#7931](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7931))

# Special notes

While this release contains many different changes, some deserve some more details.

# Optimize performance when using `SslProvider.OPENSSL` and `SslProvider.OPENSSL_REFCNT`

While you already could observe a huge performance win using our native SSL implementation we improved handshake times a lot in this release by caching the keymaterial during handshakes.

While we can do this automatically when you configure the `SslContext` to use files we can not do this without risk when you use a `KeyManagerFactory` for doing so. If you do so please consider either using `OpenSslX509KeyManagerFactory` or `OpenSslCachingX509KeyManagerFactory`.

The performance win we could observe were reducing the handshake latency by ~30-40% and the CPU usage during handshaking by up to 50%.

How much improvement you see highly depends on your service and the length of the used keychain etc so take the numbers of some caution.

# netty-tcnative compatibility

Please ensure you also update your netty-tcnative release to 2.0.12.Final as this release is not compatible with earlier releases of netty-tcnative.
