We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.111.Final. This is a bug-fix release.


The most important changes are:

* ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf | ReadOnlyUnsafeDirectByteBuf get*, copy*, duplicate*, slice* methods should be safe to be called from multiple threads ([#14072](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14072))
* ReadyOnly*Buf must return false for isWritable(*) when sliced or duplicated ([#14071](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14071))
* ReadOnlyByteBuf (and sub-classes) does not create derived buffers that share reference count ([#14076](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14076))
* ByteBuf.asReadOnly().nioBuffer*() need to return read-only ByteBuffer ([#14078](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14078))
* Remove unwanted mandatory dependency in OSGi ([#14082](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14082))
* HashedWheelTimer.stop() must cancel tasks ([#14083](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14083))
* ZSTD decompression not resilient to compression bombs ([#14004](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/14004))
* Duplicate of slice should have the same capacity as the original slice so that it's not writable ([#14093](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14093))
* Optimize wrap buffer cumulation in SslHandler and don't mutate input buffers ([#14086](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14086))
* Prepare for unsafe memory access deprecated for removal ([#14090](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14090))
* Fix AdaptiveByteBufAllocator class loading on Java 6/7 ([#14101](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14101))
* Add missing NULL checks in native code ([#14100](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14100))
