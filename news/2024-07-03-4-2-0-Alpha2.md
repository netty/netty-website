We are happy to announce the release of the second alpha for the upcoming netty version 4.2.0. Everyone using netty 4.1.x should be able to upgrade to 4.2.0.Alpha2 without any API breakage. The only new requirement is JDK8 or later. 

We encourage users of netty 4.1.x to try out this alpha release and so provide feedback if any breakage is noticed. This will help us to be  aware of any problems early in the release cycle. That said, be aware that this is only an alpha release and so __shouldn't__ be considered for production usage.

Netty 4.2.0 will come with some exciting new features that you can learn more about in the announcement of [netty 4.2.0.Alpha1](https://netty.io/news/2024/06/12/4-2-0-Alpha1.html).


The most important changes in this release are:

* Fix API compat issue for users that upgrade from 4.1.x to 4.2.0  ([#14120](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14120))
* Default hostname validation, configured via SslContextBuilder ([#14127](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14127))
* Fix the graal build ([#14133](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14133))
* Add transport-native-io_uring to docker compose files ([#14121](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14121))
* Netty 4.2.0.Alpha1 throws NoSuchMethodError: java.nio.ByteBuffer.limit(I)Ljava/nio/ByteBuffer ([#14119](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/14119))
