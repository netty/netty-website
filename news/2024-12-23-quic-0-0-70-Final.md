We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.70.Final. While containing bug-fixes it also comes with two new features that might come in handy for more advanced use cases.

The most important changes are:

* Ensure native library is loaded before making calls in the static block ([#760](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/760))
* Allow the QuicConnectionIdGenerator also take the source connection id into account ([#766](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/766))
* New BoringSSL context option - SSL_CTX_set1_sigalgs ([#765](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/765))

For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/milestone/68?closed=1).
