  <h2 id="HAddSockscodec"><span><span>Add Socks codec</span></span></h2>
  <p>This release comes with a socks codec. Be aware that it only works with Java 6 or higher because of some classes that are only available since Java 6. Checkout the "org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.socks" package for all the classes and their javadocs.</p>
  </div>
  <h1 id="HSupportasyncbindofServerChannel"><span><span>Support async bind of ServerChannel</span></span></h1>
  <p>Previous this release it was not possible to use the loved ServerBootstrap to bind to a Socket in an async fashion. This was because the ServerBootstrap.bind(..) method is blocking till the bound operation completes. Unfortunately, this is often not what you want as want to do other tasks while the bind operation completes.</p>
  <div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div>
  <p>To overcome this limitation while still keep backward compatibility we introduced 2 new methods to ServerBootstrap. These are the async counterparts of the existing bind() and bind(SocketAddress) methods.</p>
  <p>Here you see async bind in action...</p>
