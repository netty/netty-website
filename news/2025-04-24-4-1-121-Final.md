We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.121.Final. We did a quick followup release as something went wrong during our release of 4.1.120.Final yesterday and so required a different GLIBC version as expected when using our native transport.

The most important changes are:

* Epoll.isAvailable() returns false on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 arch amd64 ([#15073](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15073))
* Fix transport-native-epoll Bundle-SymbolicNames ([#15068](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15068))

For more details please visit our [bug tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.1.121.Final+is%3Aclosed)

# Thank You
