## Special notes

### ThreadLocal cache for PooledByteBufAllocator
One important thing to note about this release is that it now ships with ThreadLocal based caches for PooledByteBufAllocator to reduce conditions when allocate buffers very frequently from different Threads. This brings our implementation even closer to the [jemalloc](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc) implementation itself, as jemalloc uses a similar way to handle this kind of problem.

To give you some idea about the impact have a look at these different condition graphs. The first shows the conditions before the caches were added and the second with them added (with the same workload).

This change makes a big-difference in performance if you push things hard enough. For more details please check the [pull-request #2284](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/2284).
