# Important notes

This section will give some more details about more important changes that either change behaviour or add support for some important feature.

## Deprecation of OIO and "sub-transports"
In preparation of Netty 5 we marked the OIO transport (and any sub-transports that depend on it) as `@deprecated`. These will be removed in netty 5 and everyone should switch to either the NIO transport or one of the native transports, EPOLL or KQueue. For more details see [#8579](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8579)
