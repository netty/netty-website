title: 'Netty 4.2.0.Final released'

After a lot of work and many contributions from our OSS community we are thrilled to finally announce the release of netty 4.2.0.Final! Everyone using netty 4.1.x should be able to upgrade to 4.2.0.Final without any API breakage. The only new requirement is JDK8 or later (and JDK9+ for io_uring) and a more recent GLIBC version when using our native transports.

With the release of netty 4.2.0.Final we will also start to only merge bug-fixes into 4.1, new features will only be merged to 4.2 and main branches. While 4.1.x releases will only receive bug-fixes we will still support it 4.1.x for the time beeing, so projects can take their time to upgrade to 4.2.0.Final. That said as the upgrade should be painless we advice people to do so rather sooner than later. 

Please refer to our [Migration Guide](https://github.com/netty/netty/wiki/Netty-4.2-Migration-Guide) for all the details related to upgrades. This document also contains sections highling some best practices related to new features introduced in 4.2. 

Netty 4.2.0.Final will come with some exciting new features that you can learn more about detail in our [Migration Guide](https://github.com/netty/netty/wiki/Netty-4.2-Migration-Guide).

# New Features

This section highlights some of the most exciting features for the end-user.

## AdaptiveByteBufAllocator

In Netty 4.1.x the adaptive memory allocator was experimental. We have now made it the new default instead of the pooled allocator.

We believe that most workloads will observe reduced memory usage, with performance that is on par or slightly better than the pooled allocator. The adaptive allocator automatically tunes itself to perform well for the observed workload. It was also designed from the start to work well with virtual threads.


## MultiThreadIoEventLoopGroup

In previous versions of netty the `EventLoopGroup` implementation was tightly coupled to the respective `Channel` implementation. This made it very hard to extend existing `EventLoopGroup`s to add functionality like instrumentation (especially because you might want to use different transports based on the platform you are running on).

This has changed in 4.2.0, here you will use one `EventLoopGroup` implementation (`MultiThreadIoEventLoopGroup`) for all transports. This allows for easier customization of it (think of it like `ThreadPoolExecutor` that can be extended and customized). To make this possible we extracted the whole IO handling / multiplexing to another class that is injected into the `MultiThreadIoEventLoopGroup`.

For example:

```java
new EpollEventLoopGroup();
```

becomes

```java
new MultiThreadIoEventLoopGroup(EpollIoHandler.newFactory();
```

Other transports follow the same pattern.

`MultiThreadIoEventLoopGroup` and `SingleThreadIoEventLoop` provide various methods that can be overridden by the user and so provide the ability to:

* get a count of registered `Channel`s / `IoHandle`s
* understand how long the io processing vs task processing took
* how many `Channel`s / `IoHandle`s were processed per loop run
* customize / decorate `Promise`, `Future`.


Furthermore, it is now possible to register other things than `Channel`s, which provides a lot of possibilites to re-use netty components and also add support for other `IoHandle` implementations which does not exists as of today. For example, this could be used to implement file IO with io_uring. For a proof of concept see [#14432](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14432).

## io_uring support

In Netty 4.2.0.Final we have graduated the io_uring transport from incubator, to a fully supported first-class transport module.

As part of this work, we have made numerous refactorings to the Netty transport internals that render the incubator version entirely incompatible. The good news is that netty-transport-native-io_uring is a much superior implementation thanks to these refactorings.

Integrators are encouraged to stop using the incubator module, and instead move to Netty 4.2.0.Final for its superior io_uring integration. Doing so will unfortunately require code changes. Please refer to the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/netty/netty/wiki/Netty-4.2-Migration-Guide).

With the integration of io_uring into 4.2.0.Final we also will not continue to ship io_uring support for 4.1 (as part of the incubator project). 
Special thanks to [@axboe](https://github.com/axboe) for all the feedback and help and quickly reacting to feedback that caused changes to io_uring itself.


## ManualIoEventLoop

In the past people often asked if it would be possible to "drive" the `EventLoop` manual, which basically means to own the `Thread` that drives the `EventLoop` itself and decide by themselves when io / tasks are processed. This was not possible in netty 4.1 due of the tight coupling of `EventLoopGroup`s and `Channel`s. As this is not the case anymore with 4.2.0 we did revisit this feature request and were able to provide an implementation which does exactly what people have asked for.

An example of its usage would be:

```java
    Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();
    ManualIoEventLoop eventLoop = new ManualIoEventLoop(currentThread, NioIoHandler.newFactory());
    ServerBootstrap bootstrap = new ServerBootstrap();
    Channel channel = bootstrap.channel(NioServerSocketChannel.class)
            .handler(serverHandler).bind(0);
    while (!eventLoop.isTerminated()) {
        doSomeworkOtherWork();
        eventLoop.runNow();
    }
```

`ManualIoEventLoop` exposed various methods which allows to either run everything that is ready yet, or block until there is something ready. Please refer to the javadocs for more details.
That said this is an advanced feature and should only be used if there is a good use-case for it as care needs to be taked to process IO / tasks in a timely manner.
