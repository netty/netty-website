We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.127.Final. This is a bug-fix release which fixes a regression introduced by 4.1.126.Final that might affect you if you use BouncyCastle.
We decided to do a quick follow-up release here so people that depend on it can still get the fixes for [CVE-2025-58057](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-3p8m-j85q-pgmj) and [CVE-2025-58056](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-fghv-69vj-qj49) that were part of 4.1.125.Final.

The most important changes are:

* BouncyCastleAlpnSslUtils needs to use the correct SSLEngine class as otherwise it will fail to init static fields. ([#15628](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15628))
