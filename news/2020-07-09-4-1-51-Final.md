I am happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.51.Final which took a bit longer then expected. That said it's out now and we hope you will enjoy it :)
This is mainly a bug-fix release but also contain a few other goodies. Also this release firstly supports AARCH64 for the native epoll transport!

The most important changes in this release are:

* Modify OpenSSL native library loading to accommodate GraalVM ([#10395](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10395))
* Correctly include TLS1.3 ciphers in the enabled ciphersuites when using BoringSSL ([#10388](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10388))
* X509TrustManager with OPENSSL provider is not wrapped with hostname verification if Conscrypt is inserted in the first place ([#10375](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10375))
* Ensure we preserve the original cause of the SSLException in all cases when the native SSLEngine is used ([#10372](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10372))
* Fix memory leak in AbstractDiskHttpData when CompositeByteBuf is used ([#10360](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10360))
* Fix possible StackOverflowError when try to resolve authoritative nameservers ([#10337](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10337))
* SslHandler#wrap to preserve exception if SSLEngine is closed ([#10327](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10327))
* More values other than chunked defined in Transfer-Encoding header leads to decode failure ([#10321](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10321))
* We should fail fast when a CNAME loop is detected ([#10305](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10305))
* Dequeue all cached messages and destroy the queue instance after removing the FlowControlHandler from channel pipeline ([#10304](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10304))
* Check if SSL pointer was freed before using it in ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine in all cases ([#10299](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10299))
* Guard against re-entrancy issues while draining AbstractCoalescingBufferQueue ([#10294](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10294))
* Fix regression in HttpPostStandardRequestDecoder to always decode + to whitespace ([#10285](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10285))
* Allow to have the session tickets automatically managed by the native library ([#10280](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10280))
