Its my pleasure announcing the first RC release of Netty 4.0.0. This means we consider the software out of beta quality and will most likely release a final version soon.

Thanks again to everyone who helped us to fix issues and make the release even more stable.

You can grab the release from our [download page](http://netty.io/downloads.html) and from maven central. 

If you have any feedback please let us know, we love to receive it. 

## Notable changes

* We change our EventExecutor to return our own Future implementation (which extends java.util.concurrent.Future now). This allows you to add listeners to the returned futures and so get notified once a task was completed.  Please refer to [the API documentation](http://netty.io/4.0/api/index.html?io/netty/util/concurrent/package-summary.html) for more information. ([#1174](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/1174))
* Add the `WebSocketClientProtocolHandler`, which makes it even more easy to write WebSocket-Only clients. ([#1179](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/1179))
* Possible deadlock in Bootstrap and ServerBootstrap durring bind/connect was fixed. ([#1175](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1175))
* Fix bug which could produce a 100 % CPU spin if many NIO bases channels are closed at the same time ([#1171](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1171))
* Added alternative constructor to *Adapter classes to make them usable from languages that have no meaning for Generics. ([#1177](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1177))
* Automatically rebuild Selector if hit by e-poll bug. ([#1192](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1192))
* Do not use separate thread for scheduling deferred tasks if possible. ([#817](https://github.com/netty/netty/817))
* Other bugfixes
