I am happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.9.Final. 

This release introduces two new abstractions that allows:

* support of GSO for any `Channel` that supports it by let the user plug-in the correct implementation ([#222](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/222))
* support for different flush strategies to ensure packets are transfered in a timely manner  ([#228](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/228))

Beside these there are various other small changes.

For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/milestone/8?closed=1).
