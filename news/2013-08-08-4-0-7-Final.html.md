Only one week after the last release we though it is about time to bring you another one. This is a bug-fix release but also includes performance improvements. 

In summary we closed 10 issues.

This release would have been not possible without the feedback of our community. We welcome everyone to [become a part of it](http://netty.io/community.html), and help us to make Netty even better!
