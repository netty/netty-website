Only one week after the last release we though it is about time to bring you another one. This is a bug-fix release but also includes performance improvements. 

In summary we closed 10 issues.

This release would have been not possible without the feedback of our community. We welcome everyone to [become a part of it](http://netty.io/community.html), and help us to make Netty even better!

## Important changes
* Channel.isWritable() does not work as expected when write from outside the EventLoop ([#1697](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1697)) and ([#1702](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/1702))
* SwappedByteBuf.readSlice(int) not respect ByteOrder. ([#1704](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1704))
* Allow to also write FileRegion and ChunkInput when using HTTP chunked. ([#1693](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1693)) and ([#1699](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/1699))
