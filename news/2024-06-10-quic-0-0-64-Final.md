We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.64.Final. This release fixes multiple issues related to handling QUIC packets so you should upgrade as soon as possible.

The most important changes are:

* Only create a new QuicChannel when receiving an INITIAL packet ([#720](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/720))
* Correctly handle multiple INITIAL packets ([#721](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/721))

For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/issues?q=milestone%3A0.0.64.Final+is%3Aclosed).

For more details about this codec in general please read our [initial announcement](https://netty.io/news/2020/12/09/quic-0-0-1-Final.html).
