# Special notes

## netty-all packaging changes

This release changes the way how the netty-all artifact is packaged / produced. While before it did contain all the code of all the other modules directly with this release we changed to to just depend on all the other modules. This will help users to not end up with the same classes but different versions in the classpath while should not have much impact on most of the users. The only users that might need to be concerned about these changes are these who did directly use the netty-all jar with custom build tools. For all the other build tools it should do the right thing and automatically include the needed dependencies.
