We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.73.Final. This is a bug-fix release but also upgrades its quiche version to fix [CVE-2025-7054](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7054). Because of this we highly recommend to upgrade as soon as possible.

The most important changes are:

* Correctly map GENERIC to UNKNOWN when using BoringSSL ([#816](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/816))
* Update to quiche 0.24.5 ([#815](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/815))
* Update netty dependency ([#817](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/817))

For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.0.74.Final).
