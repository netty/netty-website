We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.118.Final. This is a bug-fix release but also fixes a ([__critical CVE__](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-4g8c-wm8x-jfhw)) in our SSL implementation. Please upgrade as soon as possible if you use our native SSL implementation.

The most important changes are:

* SslHandler doesn't correctly validate packets which can lead to native crash when using native SSLEngine ([CVE-2025-24970](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-4g8c-wm8x-jfhw))
* Denial of Service attack on windows app using Netty, again ([CVE-2025-25193](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-389x-839f-4rhx))
* Fix recycling in CodecOutputList ([#14706](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14706))
* Allocate bytebuf without magazine lock when threads get collisions ([#14594](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14594))
* Make StreamBufferingEncoder not send header frame with priority by default ([#14732](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14732))
* Notify event loop termination future of unexpected exceptions ([#14734](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14734))
* KQueueEventLoop leaks memory on shutdown ([#14745](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14745))
* Fix AccessControlException in GlobalEventExecutor ([#14743](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14743))
* Fix possible buffer leak when stream can't be mapped ([#14746](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14746))
* AdaptivePoolingAllocator: Round chunk sizes up to MIN_CHUNK_SIZE units and reduce chunk release frequency ([#14763](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14763))
