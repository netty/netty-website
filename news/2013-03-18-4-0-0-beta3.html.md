Thank you everyone for giving Netty 4.0.0.Beta2 a try.  We were able to squash many bugs thanks to your input, and I&#39;m proud to call this release the last beta before the candidate release!  As you know, your input is crucial for us to produce more stable and easier-to-use release.  It will be awesome if you have a chance to [get involved into the Netty project](http://netty.io/community.html) as well as you [download](http://netty.io/downloads.html) it.

## Notable changes

* Our future/promise API has been refactored so that it can be used without an associated `Channel` at all.  You will like this change if you did not like `java.util.concurrent.Future`.  Please refer to [the API documentation](http://netty.io/4.0/api/index.html?io/netty/util/concurrent/package-summary.html) for more information. ([#1065](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1065))
* `ChannelHandler.userEventTriggered()` event handler method has been moved to `ChannslStateHandler`. ([#1107](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1107))
* Potential I/O starvation in `NioEventLoop` has been fixed by introducing a parameter called `ioRatio`, which allows you to limit the percentage of time spent by non-I/O tasks. ([#1154](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1154))
* `ByteToByteEncoder` now intercepts a `sendFile(FileRegion)` operation and filter the content of the `FileRegion` for your convenience. ([#1106](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/1106))
* Google protobuf has been upgraded to version 2.5 to get decoding performance improvement. ([#1139](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/1139))
* `ChannelHandlerContext.nextInbound/OutboundBufferType()` has been added for handlers that have to behave differently depending on the type of the next handler&#39;s buffer. ([#1132](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/1132))
* `ChannelOutboundMessageHandlerAdapter.beginFlush()` now has to return a boolean value to accept or reject the flush request where the default implementation is to accept. ([#1141](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1141))
* `ByteBuf.hasMemoryAddress()` and `ByteBuf.memoryAddress()` were added to allow a user access the buffer using `sun.misc.Unsafe` for even faster buffer access. ([#1110](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1110))
* `ThreadPerChannelEventLoopGroup` and `ThreadPerChannelEventLoop` have been added to allow a user to build a thread-per-channel transport more easily. ([#1124](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1124))
* 17 bug fixes and more
