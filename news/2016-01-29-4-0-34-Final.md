I'm happy to announce the release of Netty 4.0.34.Final.

This release contains 110+ changes, including bug-fixes, performance improvements and new features.

The most important changes are:

* SslHandler does not send SSL close notify after receiving an invalid client certificate ([#3900](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3900))
* High CPU usage with SO_LINGER and sudden connection close (4.0.26.Final+) ([#4449](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4449))
* DefaultPromise LateListener notification order ([#4492](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4492))
* Respect ClientAuth set via OpenSslEngine constructor ([#4576](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4576))
* Throw ReadOnlyBufferException if unsafe buffer is used and dst is direct ([#4577](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4577))
* Prevent adding newline if Base64 buffer encoded ends directly on MAX_LINE_LENGTH ([#4595](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4595)
* isKeepAlive is not supported by Epoll ([#4604](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4604))
* Customizable estimation for messages written outside the EventLoop ([#4620](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4620))
* Ensure closing a Socket / FileDescriptor multiple times will not throw exception ([#4623](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4623))
* Set DSCP bits for IPv6 when setting traffic class. ([#4650](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4650))
* Stop decoding if decoder was removed ([#4651](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4651))
* Ensure we only add OpenSslEngine to the OpenSslEngineMap when handshake is started ([#4653](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4653))
* Unpooled and Wrapped Buffer Leak ([#4667](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4667))
* Decryption failed or bad mac record in Android 5.0 ([#4678](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4678))
* IndexOutOfBoundsException for CompositeByteBuf ([#4681](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4681))
* Let CombinedChannelDuplexHandler correctly handle exceptionCaught. ([#4702](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4702))
* Correctly handle non handshake commands when using SniHandler ([#4703](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4703))
* Implement proper resource leak detection for CompositeByteBuf ([#4713](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4713))
* OpenSslEngine.setEnabledProtocols fails to enable protocols that are currently disabled ([#4736](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4736))
* Ensure ChannelHandler.handlerAdded(...) is always called as first method of the handler ([#4776](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4776))
* SslHandler should call beginHandshake once for the initial handshake ([#4764](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4764))
* Ensure the whole certificate chain is used when creating SslContext for client mode and SslProvider.OPENSSL is used ([#4767](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4767))
* Correctly handle wildcard address when bind to socket and using native transport ([#4770](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4770))
