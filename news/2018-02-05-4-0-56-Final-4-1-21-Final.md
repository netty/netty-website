# Important notes

## HTTP2

The `Http2ConnectionHandler` API was slightly adjusted to be able to detect if an error was caused by an outbound or inbound operation. If you override any of the on*Error(...) methods you will need to adjust for it.

## 4.0.x releases

As noted before this was the last release we will do for the 4.0 tree. If you not use 4.1.x yet you will need to upgrade if you want to receive more bug-fixes.


As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!
