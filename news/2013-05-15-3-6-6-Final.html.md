One month after the release of Netty 3.6.5.Final it was about time to ship 3.6.6.Final. This release is cut from [the 3.x branch](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/3) and is a bug-fix only release, so no new features are included.  You can get it from [the downloads page](http://netty.io/downloads.html) and the Maven central repository.  Please report any regressions or bugs via [the issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues).

In total this release "fixes" 16 issues.
