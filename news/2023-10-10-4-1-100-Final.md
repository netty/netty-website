We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.100.Final. This release fixes a HTTP2 DDOS attack vector which effects any HTTP/2 Server, also called "HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack". If you use netty to run a HTTP/2 server we urge you to upgrade as soon as possible. 

The most important changes are:

* DDoS vector in the HTTP/2 protocol due RST frames ([#GHSA-xpw8-rcwv-8f8p](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-xpw8-rcwv-8f8p)) 
* Do not fail when compressing empty HttpContent ([#13655](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13655)) 

## DDOS HTTP/2 protection - HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack

As stated above this release includes an by default protection for the HTTP/2 DDOS issue ([#GHSA-xpw8-rcwv-8f8p](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-xpw8-rcwv-8f8p)).
This is done by limiting the amount of RST frames a remote peer can send on a connection in given time window. You can adjust the configuration of these settings via one of these builders if needed:

- `Http2ConnectionHandlerBuilder`
- `Http2FrameCodecBuilder`
- `HttpMultiplexCodecBuilder`
