title: 'Netty 4.1.19.Final released'

Unfortunately, just a week after we released netty 4.1.18.Final we found a regression which could cause a core-dump when using one of the native transports and trying to write a `CompositeByteBuf`. To fix this regression we just released netty 4.1.19.Final . If you use 4.1.18.Final and one of the native transports we highly recommend upgrading to this new release to ensure you not see any core-dumps.

This regression only exists on the 4.1 release series and _NOT_ on the 4.0 series, which means a new 4.0 release was not needed.

For more details on the problem please read:

* FileDescriptor writev core dump ([#7507](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7507))

Beside this regression-fix we also fixed 2 other issues, one of the changes fixes a bug which made it impossible to use native transports of netty as java9 modules.

For the details and all changes, please browse our issue tracker for [4.1.19.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.1.19.Final).

As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!
