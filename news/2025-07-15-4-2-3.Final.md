# Special notes

## AdaptiveByteBufAllocator improvements
The `AdaptiveByteBufAllocator` did see a lot of changes this release to not only fixing bugs but also decrease it's memory overhead dramatically. To ensure we don't regress in the future and also allow others to better understand the characteristics we also added an allocation pattern simulator. For some more details about the improvements please refer to [#15429](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15429)

## IoUring improvements
We continue to improve our io_uring based thransport as it is relative new. The improvements include adding new features but also just improve the performance in general. Beside this we also changed a few defaults to better reflect usual workloads. For more details on all the changes please refer to the changes listed above that are prefixed with `IoUring`.

## JFR event support
We finally added JFR event support and added usafe of it for the `AdaptiveByteBufAllocator` and `PooledByteBufAllocator`. This allows to better understand the allocation pattern and memory usage of each of the allocators. 
We plan to add more and more support to other internals soon.
