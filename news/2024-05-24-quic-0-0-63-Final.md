We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.63.Final. This release fixes a few issues but also introduce a possible breaking change (shouldn't affect most people).

The most important changes are:

* Update to netty 4.1.110.Final ([#718](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/718))
* Remove usage of QuicheError in public API as its an implementation detail of Quiche ([#711](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/711))
* Update to latest quiche commit sha. ([#716](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/716))

For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/issues?q=milestone%3A0.0.63.Final+is%3Aclosed).

For more details about this codec in general please read our [initial announcement](https://netty.io/news/2020/12/09/quic-0-0-1-Final.html).

# Breaking change

This release removes `QuicheError` from public API and replace it by `QuicTransportError`. For more details see ([#711](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/711))
