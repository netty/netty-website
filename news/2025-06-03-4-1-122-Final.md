We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.122.Final. This is a bug-fix release.

The most important changes are:

* DirContextUtils.addNameServer(...) should just catch Exception internally ([#15108](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/15108))
* Make public API specify explicit maxAllocation to prevent OOM ([#15122](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15122))
* Fix concurrent ByteBuf write access bug in adaptive allocator ([#15132](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15132))
* Fix transport-native-kqueue Bundle-SymbolicNames ([#15075](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15075))
* Fix resolver-dns-native-macos Bundle-SymbolicNames ([#15076](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15076))
* Always correctly calculate the memory address of the ByteBuf even if sun.misc.Unsafe is not usable ([#15144](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15144))
* Upgrade lz4 dependencies as the old version did not correctly handle ByteBuffer that have an arrayOffset > 0 ([#15147](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15147))
* Optimize ByteBuf.setCharSequence for adaptive allocator ([#15170](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15170))
* Kqueue: Fix registration failure when fd is reused ([#15162](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15162))
* Make JdkZlibEncoder accept Deflater.DEFAULT_COMPRESSION as level ([#15220](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15220))
* Ensure OpenSsl.availableJavaCipherSuites does not contain null values ([#15219](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15219))
* Always prefer direct buffers for pooled allocators if not explicit disabled ([#15245](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15245))
* Update to netty-tcnative 2.0.72.Final ([#15248](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15248))
* Re-enable sun.misc.Unsafe by default on Java 24+ ([#15296](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15296))
* Kqueue: Delay removal from registration map to fix noisy warnings  ([#15293](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15293))

# Special notes

We decided to enable `sun.misc.Unsafe` by default again when using JDK24+ (when possible) as disabling it by default on this java versions did come with quite a performance regression.
For more details see ([#15296](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/15296)). Be aware that this is only needed for 4.1.x, in 4.2.x we are able to fix this in another way that does not require the usage of `sun.misc.Unsafe`.
