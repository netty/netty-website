We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.115.Final. This is a bug-fix release but also include a fix for ([CVE-2024-47535](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-xq3w-v528-46rv)) which we rate as very low as the attacker needs to have access to the local filesystem with the right permissions.


The most important changes are:

* Allow MessageToMessageDecoder to take care of reading more data when needed ([#14372](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14372))
* Fix SSL session resumption with ClientAuth.OPTIONAL and add tests with session tickets 
 ([#14404](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14404))

* Fix bug where SslHandler may stall after TLSv1.3 handshake with delegate tasks ([#14411](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14411))
* AdaptiveByteBufAllocator: Make pooling of AdaptiveByteBuf magazine local ([#14414](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14414))
* Specialize Adaptive's allocator Recycler based on magazine's owner ([#14421](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14421))
* Fix epoll_wait retry loop ([#14425](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14425))
* Log / include the correct error during handshake failure ([#14428](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14428))
* Convey autoAckPing in http2 decoder constructor chain ([#14429](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14429))
* Allow to set used named groups per OpenSslContext ([#14433](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14433))
* Verify default named groups before using them with native SSL implementation ([#14434](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14434))
* Include details on why it was not possible to configure accepted issuers in the SSLException ([#14435](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14435))
* Correctly detect if KeyManager is not supported by OpenSSL version ([#14437](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14437))
* Preserve ordering of default named groups during conversation ([#14447](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/14447))
* Denial of Service attack on windows app using netty ([CVE-2024-47535](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-xq3w-v528-46rv))
